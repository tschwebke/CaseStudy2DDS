# DDSAnalytics â€“ Employee Attrition

 
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. 

Talent management is the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It includes:
* workforce planning

* reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition)

DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management to gain a competitive edge over its competition. Executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. 

The DDSAnalytics data science team will conduct an analysis of existing employee data as a first step.
